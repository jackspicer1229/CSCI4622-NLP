Project for CSCI4622 Machine Learning Course

Link to the dataset we will be using: https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html#subsets

We start by looking at the Digital Music 5-core review dataset, which is a subset of the entire review database

I have added a compressed version of the data to this github repository. To unzip it, run the following command from a CLI:

```gzip -d Digital_Music_5.json.gz ```
